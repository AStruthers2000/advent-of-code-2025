## üöÄ Project Overview

The project is structured with modularity and maintainability in mind:

- Each day's solution is implemented as a subclass of a base `Problem` class, allowing for:
    - Easy organization of daily challenges.
    - A polymorphic array of `Problem` instances for streamlined execution.
- Utility modules and submodules provide reusable functionality for:
    - Math utilities.
    - String parsing.
    - Algorithms.
    - Data structures.
- The codebase takes full advantage of **C++23 features** such as:
    - `std::optional` for expressive and safe optional values.
    - Template classes and functions for flexibility and type safety.
    - Modules for clean code organization and dependency management.

This repository not only documents my journey through the Advent of Code challenges but also serves as a playground to deepen my understanding of **modern C++ development methodologies**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Environment

- **Language:** C++23
- **IDE:** JetBrains CLion.
- **Compiler:** MSVC with support for C++23 and modules.
- **Build System:** CMake (Version 3.28)
- **Unit Tests:** CppUTest

## üß© How It Works

1. **Problem Structure:** Each problem is a subclass of `Problem`, implementing specific functionality for the corresponding day. This design ensures that:
    - Code for each problem is modular and encapsulated.
    - A single polymorphic array can store and execute all problems dynamically.

2. **Utilities:** Common utilities like string parsing and math functions are placed in dedicated modules, making them reusable and improving code readability.

3. **Modern C++ Practices:**
    - Use of `std::optional` for optional values.
    - Extensive use of templates for generalized solutions.
    - Modular programming with `import` statements for better organization.

## üìã Usage

### Adding a New Problem TODO fixme
1. Create a new `DayXX` class and `DayXX` folder in the `Solution/Problems` folder.
2. Inherit from the `Problem` base class.
3. Implement the `LoadProblem()`, `SolvePart1()`, and `SolvePart2()` methods for the problem logic.
4. Add the new problem to the array in `AdventOfCode2024.cpp`.

## üéØ Goals

This project aims to:
- Solve the Advent of Code 2025 challenges in a clean, efficient, and modular way.
- Embrace and explore modern C++23 features and development methodologies.
- Serve as a learning resource and reference for modular programming in C++.
